# Images & Media

An image is never just decoration. It establishes credibility, creates a sense of place, shows something that words can't, or gives a reader a moment to breathe between ideas. How you place an image shapes how it functions---whether it commands the full page, sits beside an argument, or anchors a section.

Xanthan gives you a small set of placement tools, each suited to a different editorial intention. That's deliberate: rather than infinite options that require infinite decisions, you have a few choices that each do something well. Knowing what each one does is how you choose intentionally.

---

## Stand-alone images

Use the `figure.html` include to place a single image in your content. It's always centered and sits on its own---it gets its own visual moment, and whatever follows starts cleanly below it. You decide how big it is with `image-width`.

```
{% raw %}{% include images/figure.html
  image-width="60%"
  caption="What a nice view"
  alt-text="Hiking trails winding through a canyon in the Sandia foothills."
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include images/figure.html
  image-width="60%"
  caption="What a nice view"
  alt-text="Hiking trails winding through a canyon in the Sandia foothills."
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
%}

### Choosing a width

`image-width` accepts any CSS width. Two common choices:

**Full-width** (`image-width="100%"`) --- the image commands the entire content column. The most common choice for photographs, maps, or anything that deserves full attention. Make sure your source image is at least 1200px wide to avoid looking grainy.

{% include images/figure.html image-width="100%" caption="A full-width image commands the full content column." image-path="/assets/images/site/default.jpg" %}

**A smaller centered width** --- good when the image doesn't need to fill the full column, or when a smaller image would look lost at full width.

{% include images/figure.html
  image-width="60%"
  caption="Centered at 60% width."
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
%}

When you want an image *beside* text rather than above or below it, use `figure-wrap.html`---the recommended tool for pairing an image with text. See [Image alongside text](#image-alongside-text) below; that's also how you offset an image to one side of the page.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Options | What it does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `image-path` | File path | Path to the image file |
| `image-width` | Any CSS value (`40%`, `300px`) | Width of the image (default: 40%) |
| `caption` | Text | Caption displayed below the image |
| `alt-text` | Text | Accessibility description (falls back to caption) |

---

## Image alongside text

Sometimes an image and a passage of text belong together as equals---neither subordinate to the other, both necessary to the point. Use `figure-wrap.html` to place them side by side as an explicit two-column pair.

```
{% raw %}{% include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
  caption="What a nice view"
  alt-text="Hiking trail through a canyon in the Sandia foothills."
  image-position="right"
  image-width="45%"
  text="The text you put here sits beside the image, not below it. Good for introductory paragraphs, a key argument tied to a specific image, or whenever the visual and the words need to be read together. Content that follows the include starts at full width below both columns."
%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
  caption="What a nice view"
  alt-text="Hiking trail through a canyon in the Sandia foothills."
  image-position="right"
  image-width="45%"
  text="The text you put here sits beside the image, not below it. Good for introductory paragraphs, a key argument tied to a specific image, or whenever the visual and the words need to be read together. Content that follows the include starts at full width below both columns."
%}

The design forces a useful editorial question: *which* text belongs paired with this image? That's a decision worth making deliberately.

### Image on the left

With `image-position` omitted (or set to `left`), the image sits on the left:

{% include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
  image-width="35%"
  text="Left-aligned image at 35% width. The text column takes the remaining space. Markdown is supported in the text parameter---**bold**, *italic*, [links](#), and even line breaks."
%}

### Long text stays in its column

When the text is longer than the image is tall, it continues in the text column---it does not flow underneath the image. Whatever comes after the include starts at full width below both columns.

{% include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/hike-1.jpg"
  image-position="right"
  image-width="35%"
  text="This paragraph is long enough to extend past the bottom of the image. Notice that the text stays in its own column throughout---it doesn't wrap under the image the way a floated image would behave. The two columns are independent. When the text runs long, the image column simply ends at the image bottom and leaves empty space below it. This is predictable, intentional behavior: you know exactly what you're getting. The content that follows this include will start at full width, below the taller of the two columns."
%}

This is content after the figure-wrap. It starts at full width below both columns.

### Parameters

| Parameter | Options / Default | What it does |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| `image-path` | (required) | Path to the image file |
| `text` | (required) | Text beside the image; supports Markdown |
| `caption` | (none) | Caption below the image; supports Markdown |
| `alt-text` | Falls back to caption | Accessibility description for screen readers |
| `image-position` | `left` (default), `right` | Which side the image appears on |
| `image-width` | `40%` (default) | CSS width of the image column |

On small screens, the layout collapses to a single column with the image on top.

Both image includes share `image-width`, so sizing works the same way whether an image stands alone or sits beside text. `image-position` is unique to `figure-wrap`---a standalone `figure.html` image is always centered, so there's no side to choose.

---

## Alt-text

{% include typography/alert.html
  class="info"
  title="Why Alt-Text Matters"
  text="**Alt-text** (alternative text) is a written description of an image that screen readers read aloud for visually impaired users. Including alt-text makes your site accessible to everyone.

- Describe the image content and context, not just what you see
- Focus on what's relevant to your narrative or argument
- Keep it concise but descriptive (typically 1-2 sentences)
- Avoid redundant phrases like 'image of' or 'picture of'

If you don't include an `alt-text` parameter, the caption will be used as the alt-text, which is better than nothing but not always ideal.

**Pro tip:** Alt-text and captions serve different purposes. Captions can be more interpretive or contextual ('This transformation took only six months'), while alt-text should be descriptive ('Two photos side by side showing a vacant lot and then a completed brick building')."
%}

---

## Jumbotron images

A jumbotron breaks out of the page's content column to fill the full browser width---the most cinematic option available. Use one as a visual break between sections, or add a text overlay. The gradient fade is applied automatically so text reads cleanly against the image.

```
{% raw %}{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="50vh"
  box-align="left"
  title="Optional heading"
  text="A pull quote or caption on the clear side of the image."
  background-position="center right"
%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="50vh"
  box-align="left"
  title="Optional heading"
  text="A pull quote or caption on the clear side of the image."
  background-position="center right"
%}

### No text or fade

If you omit `text` and `title`, the gradient is skipped and the jumbotron renders as a clean full-width visual break---useful as section dividers on long pages.

{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="30vh"
  background-position="center 60%"
%}

```
{% raw %}{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="30vh"
  background-position="center 60%"
%}{% endraw %}
```

### Heading, zoom, and custom fade

Use `zoom` to enlarge the image and `fade-start`/`fade-end` to control how quickly the gradient appears and disappears.

{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="50vh"
  box-align="right"
  title="Landscape at dusk"
  zoom="150%"
  background-position="center left"
  fade-start="10%"
  fade-end="80%"
%}

```
{% raw %}{% include images/jumbotron.html
  image-path="/assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg"
  height="50vh"
  box-align="right"
  title="Landscape at dusk"
  zoom="150%"
  background-position="center left"
  fade-start="10%"
  fade-end="80%"
%}{% endraw %}
```

### Parameters

| Parameter | Default | What it does |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| `image-path` | (required) | Path to image |
| `height` | `40vh` | CSS height, e.g. `50vh` or `400px` |
| `box-align` | `left` | `left`, `right`, or `center` — text position and gradient direction |
| `title` | (none) | Heading above the text |
| `text` | (none) | Body text; supports Markdown. Gradient applied automatically when present |
| `zoom` | `cover` | CSS `background-size`; e.g. `150%` to zoom in |
| `background-position` | `center` | CSS `background-position`; aim the subject away from the text side |
| `fade-start` | `0%` | Where the opaque gradient begins |
| `fade-end` | `60%` | Where the gradient becomes fully transparent |
| `bg-color` | `var(--bg-page)` | Color of the opaque side; matches page background by default |
| `caption` | (none) | Caption below the image; supports Markdown |

**`box-align` controls both text placement and gradient direction:**

| `box-align` | Text position | Gradient |
|-------------|---------------|----------|
| `left` (default) | Left side | Opaque left → transparent right |
| `right` | Right side | Opaque right → transparent left |
| `center` | Centered over image | No gradient; text shadow used for legibility |

---

## Header images

A header image is a large banner across the top of the page, set in the front matter rather than in the content body:

```yaml
---
title: My Page Title
layout: default
header-image: /assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg
---
```

### Controlling height and position

```yaml
---
title: My Page Title
layout: default
header-image: /assets/images/backgrounds/pano-1.jpg
header-height: 50vh
header-position: center
---
```

| Field | Default | What it does |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| `header-height` | `40vh` | Height of the header (e.g. `50vh`, `300px`) |
| `header-position` | (browser default) | Which part of the image to show (`center`, `top`, `200px`, `50% 80%`) |

`header-position` is particularly useful when you have a large image but only a specific part---the sky, the bottom half---is what you want visible in the header crop.

---

## Before/after slider (Juxtapose)

Compare two images with a draggable slider---ideal for historic vs. contemporary photos, before/after transformations, or any visual comparison where the reader should be able to move between the two states themselves.

```
{% raw %}{% include images/juxtapose.html
  image1="/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-tv-room.jpg"
  image2="/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-hist-common-room.jpg"
  caption="The TV room becomes the History Department Common Room."
%}{% endraw %}
```

{% include images/juxtapose.html
image1="/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-tv-room.jpg"
image2="/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-hist-common-room.jpg"
caption="From the TV room to the Chair room (actually, the History Department Common Room). With a less good view of the mountains."
%}

| Parameter | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| `image1` | Path to the first (left) image |
| `image2` | Path to the second (right) image |
| `caption` | Optional caption below the slider |
| `starting-position` | Where the slider starts (default: 50%) |

The effect is most striking when the two images are taken from the same vantage point.

---

## Image carousel

Display a series of images as a slideshow. Define three lists (images, headers, captions) and pass them to the carousel include:

```
{% raw %}{% assign images =
"/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-construction.jpg,
/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-room-cost.jpg,
/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-tv-room.jpg" | split: ','
%}

{% assign headers =
"A Photo Title,,
No caption here" | split: ','
%}

{% assign captions =
"It's useful to have informative captions|
This image has a caption, but no title|
" | split: '|'
%}

{% include images/carousel.html
  width="80%"
  class="center"
  images=images
  headers=headers
  captions=captions
%}{% endraw %}
```

{%
assign images =
"/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-construction.jpg,
/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-room-cost.jpg,
/scrollstories/forest/images/mvh-tv-room.jpg" | split: ','
%}

{%
assign headers =
"A Photo Title,,
No caption here" | split: ','
%}

{%
assign captions =
"It's useful to have informative captions|
This image has a caption, but no title|
" | split: '|'
%}

{% include images/carousel.html
width = "80%"
class = "center"
images = images
headers = headers
captions = captions
%}

| Parameter | What it does |
|-----------|--------------|
| `width` | Width of the carousel (default: 100%) |
| `class` | Alignment: `left`, `center`, `right` |
| `id` | Unique ID if you have multiple carousels on one page |
| `images` | List of image paths |
| `headers` | List of slide titles (use empty values for no title) |
| `captions` | List of slide captions (split on `\|` to allow commas in text) |

## ScrollStory images

For more cinematic image effects, ScrollStories offer techniques where images stay fixed while text scrolls over them, backgrounds switch as the reader advances, and panels slide horizontally alongside fixed visuals. These go beyond standard image placement into full narrative design.

See the [ScrollStories overview](../scrollstories/) to learn what's available, or jump directly to [Peekaboo images](../scrollstories/peekaboo) for a parallax-style reveal effect that works on any page.

## Making your images smaller

A photograph straight from a phone or a museum download is often 4000 pixels
wide and several megabytes. Nothing on a web page needs that, and a page full of
them is slow to open on a phone — which is where a good share of your readers
are. Shrinking them changes nothing a reader can see.

You do not need a command line for this. Your site ships with a job that does it
for you:

1. Go to the **Actions** tab of your repository on GitHub
2. Choose **Optimize Images** in the left-hand list
3. Click **Run workflow**, and check the settings:

| Setting | What it means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Folder** | Which folder to work through. `assets/images` covers your site's shared images; an essay's own folder works too, like `essays/my-essay/images`, and `.` does the whole site |
| **Longest edge** | The biggest either side is allowed to be. `1600` suits a full-width image; use `2400` for something meant to be looked at closely |
| **Quality** | JPEG quality out of 100. `85` is a good default. Below about `70` you start to see it |
| **Actually change the files** | Leave this **unticked** the first time |

4. Click the green **Run workflow** button

The first run changes nothing. It reports what it *would* do — file by file,
with the size before and after — in the run summary. Read that, and if the
numbers look right, run it again with **Actually change the files** ticked.

When it runs for real it commits the smaller images for you, and your site
rebuilds a minute or two later. Your originals are still in the repository's
history if you ever want them back.

**It also converts PNGs to JPGs** where that saves a lot and the image has no
transparency — photographs saved as PNG are often several times larger than they
need to be. When it does, it updates the references to match — in your pages,
data files and stylesheets — so nothing breaks.

{% include typography/alert.html
class="info"
title="Already-optimized images are left alone"
text="The job skips anything that is already small enough, and keeps any original that re-compressing would barely shrink, so running it twice does no harm and running it after adding a few new photographs only touches the new ones."
%}

If you do work at a command line, the same thing runs locally:

```bash
bash scripts/optimize-images.sh --preview --recursive --base-dir assets/images
```

Drop `--preview` to apply it. `bash scripts/optimize-images.sh --help` lists the
rest of the options.

---

## Troubleshooting

{% include typography/alert.html
  class="warning"
  title="Image paths: the most common source of problems"
  text="Paths can be **relative** or **absolute**, and mixing them up is the number one reason images don't appear.

- **Absolute path** (starts with `/`): `/assets/images/photo.jpg` --- works from any page on your site, because it starts from the site root. **This is the safer choice.**
- **Relative path** (no leading `/`): `images/photo.jpg` --- relative to the current page's location. A path that works on `essays/my-essay.md` won't work on `index.md` if the image isn't in the right place relative to that page.

**When in doubt, use absolute paths.** They always resolve the same way regardless of which page you're on. And remember: paths are case-sensitive. `Photo.jpg` is not the same as `photo.jpg`."
%}

---

## Embedding media

Beyond images, you can embed audio, video, and 3D models. In most cases you copy an "embed code" from a service like YouTube or SketchFab and paste it onto your page. For a few formats Xanthan provides an include so the markup stays standardized and easy to maintain.

### Sound files

To embed a sound file with a simple playback interface, use the `audio.html` include and set `src` to the path of your file.

```
{% raw %}
{% include media/audio.html
  src="/assets/audio/sample-audio.mp3"
%}
{% endraw %}
```

### Embed codes from other services

For YouTube, Vimeo, SketchFab, and similar services, copy the embed code the service gives you and paste it directly into your page. It will render as-is.


**Image doesn't appear:**
- Check that the file path and filename match exactly (paths are case-sensitive)
- Verify the image file has been committed to your repository
- Make sure the path starts with `/` for absolute paths or is correct relative to the current page

**Image looks grainy or stretched:**
- Use images large enough for the display width (at least 1200px wide for full-width images)
- JPG works well for photographs; PNG is better for diagrams or screenshots with text

**Header image not showing:**
- Ensure `header-image` is in the front matter block (between the `---` lines), not in the page content
- Check the path carefully---it should start with `/`

For more help, see [Troubleshooting](../reference/troubleshooting).
